If you have not installed the packages vplanet and vplanet_inference you first need to install these. import os import numpy as np from astropy import units as u import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib import rcParams rcParams['font.family'] = 'stixgeneral' rcParams['text.usetex'] = False rcParams['xtick.labelsize'] = 16 rcParams['ytick.labelsize'] = 16 rcParams['axes.labelsize'] = 16 import vplanet_inference as vpi . Set up input and output file directories . vplanet_inference requires that we have a set of template infiles saved somewhere. We will call the directory containing the infiles the inpath. It also requires that we specify an outpath directory where infiles will be copied from inpath and written with the substituted parameters that we specify. # Specify the directory to read infile templates from inpath = os.path.join(vpi.INFILE_DIR, \"stellar/\") # Speficy the directory where infiles will be written to outpath = \"output/\" . astropy units . vplanet_inference makes use of a package called astropy to specify and handle all unit conversions in its calculations. You can check out the astropy docs for an in-depth explanation for how to use astropy.units, but some useful units we’ll use here are: . | Unit | Symbol | astropy variable | . | Solar mass | $M_\\odot$ | u.Msun | . | Solar luminosity | $L_\\odot$ | u.Lsun | . | Solar radius | $R_\\odot$ | u.Rsun | . | year | yr | u.yr | . | no units |   | u.dimensionless_unscaled | . Units can manipulated and converted to other units, for example: . 10 * u.m / u.s . $10 \\; \\mathrm{\\frac{m}{s}}$ . (1*u.Msun).to(u.kg) . $1.9884099 \\times 10^{30} \\; \\mathrm{kg}$ . (5 * u.km / u.hr).to(u.m / u.s) . $1.3888889 \\; \\mathrm{\\frac{m}{s}}$ . Specify model Input parameters . We can choose which variables in the infiles that we want to vary by creating a dictionary called inparams. The dict keys follow the convention &lt;infile name&gt;.&lt;variable name&gt; and the dict values specify the units for the variables using astropy.units. # Dictionary of input parameters and units inparams = {\"star.dMass\": u.Msun, \"vpl.dStopTime\": u.Gyr} . Specify model Output parameters . Similarly we can also create a dictionary called outparams which tells vplanet_inference which variables to add to our saOutputOrder for each body. The dict keys follow the convention final.&lt;body name&gt;.&lt;variable name&gt;, and the dict values use astropy.units. # Dictionary of output parameters and units outparams = {\"final.star.Radius\": u.Rsun, \"final.star.Luminosity\": u.Lsun} . Initialize the vplanet model . Once we’ve specified our input and output variables (inparams and outparams), and the directories where input and output files will be read/written (inpath and outpath), we can initialize a VplanetModel. In addition, we can also specify the time_init (the initial time at which the simulation starts) and the timesteps (how frequently the outputs will be spaced). So if we set time_init=5e6*u.yr and timesteps=1e6*u.yr this will give us output times spaced like: [5e6, 6e6, 7e6, …, 8.999e9, 9e9] . Setting verbose = True will tell the model to print out progress info when we run the model. vpm = vpi.VplanetModel(inparams=inparams, outparams=outparams, inpath=inpath, outpath=outpath, time_init=5e6*u.yr, timesteps=1e6*u.yr, verbose=True) . Example: evolution of the sun . As an example, we’ll compute the evolution of a sun-like star. We’ll define a variable called theta, which will be our array of values that we substitute in for the inparameters. These values should be the same order and units that we specified in our inparams dictionary. For this example, we’ll set star.dMass to 1.0 solar masses, and vpl.dStopTime (the final age of the system) to 9.0 gigayears. We can also optionally choose to save the written infiles to a specified outsubpath if we wish to inspect those later, such as for debugging. (If you run many simulations though, it is often better to say remove=True which deletes the infiles after the results are read. This will save you disk space.) . # Run the vplanet model theta = np.array([1.0, 9.0]) evol = vpm.run_model(theta, remove=False, outsubpath=\"solar_evol\") . Input: ----------------- star.dMass : 1.0 [solMass] (user) ---&gt; 1.988409870698051e+30 [kg] (vpl file) vpl.dStopTime : 9.0 [Gyr] (user) ---&gt; 2.840184e+17 [s] (vpl file) Created file output//solar_evol/vpl.in Created file output//solar_evol/star.in Executed model output//solar_evol/vpl.in 9.074 s Output: ----------------- final.star.Luminosity : 1.46994644723093 [solLum] final.star.Radius : 1.2128696277130946 [solRad] . The results of our evolution model are saved to a variable called evol. If you print the results, you’ll see that evol is a dictionary, where the keys are the variables we specified in our outparams dictionary, and the values of the dictionary are arrays containing value of each variable at each timestep with the units we specified. evol . {'final.star.Luminosity': &lt;VPLANETQuantity [0.64096578, 0.57682419, 0.53206505, ..., 1.46994645, 1.46994645, 1.46994645] solLum&gt;, 'final.star.Radius': &lt;VPLANETQuantity [1.43389392, 1.36010004, 1.3032261 , ..., 1.21286963, 1.21286963, 1.21286963] solRad&gt;, 'Time': &lt;VPLANETQuantity [0.00000000e+00, 1.00000000e+06, 2.00000000e+06, ..., 8.99800048e+09, 8.99899866e+09, 9.00000000e+09] yr&gt;} . Plotting the evolution . We can plot the results showing the stars luminosity evolution vs. time: . plt.figure(figsize=[8,6]) plt.plot(evol[\"Time\"], evol[\"final.star.Luminosity\"]) plt.xlabel(\"Time [yr]\") plt.ylabel(\"Luminosity [L$_\\odot$]\") plt.xscale(\"log\") plt.yscale(\"log\") plt.show() . Task: plot the evolution of the star’s radius . [your code goes here...] . Options for output variables . Take a look at the files that the model has created in outpath directory. Within the local directory of this notebook, you should see a list of files like: . output/ solar_evol/ star.in system.log system.star.forward vpl.in . Now see what output parameters you can add to outparams. For a description of available output options for each vplanet model, see the documentation here. You can also open up the log file for one of the simulations we’ve run, which should show a list of variables like this. For example, the file infile_templates/solar_evol/system.log should contain a list that looks something like this: . -------- Log file system.log ------- Executable: /home/jbirky/.conda/envs/py39/bin/vplanet Version: Unknown System Name: system Primary Input File: vpl.in Body File #1: star.in Allow files to be overwitten: Yes Mass Units: Grams Length Units: Meters Time Units: Seconds Angle Units: Radians ------- FORMATTING ----- Verbosity Level: 0 Crossover Decade for Scientific Notation: 4 Number of Digits After Decimal: 6 Integration Method: Runge-Kutta4 Direction: Forward Time Step: 3.155760e+07 Stop Time: 2.840184e+17 Output Interval: 3.155760e+13 Use Variable Timestep: Yes dEta: 0.010000 Minimum Value of ecc and obl: 1.000000e-10 ---- INITIAL SYSTEM PROPERTIES ---- (Age) System Age [sec]: 1.577880e+14 (Time) Simulation Time [sec]: 0.000000 (TotAngMom) Total Angular Momentum [kg*m^2/sec]: 2.904811e+43 (TotEnergy) Total System Energy [kg*m^2/sec^2]: -1.576626e+41 (PotEnergy) Body's non-orbital Potential Energy [kg*m^2/sec^2]: -1.587188e+41 (KinEnergy) Body's non-orbital Kinetic Energy [kg*m^2/sec^2]: 1.056219e+39 (DeltaTime) Average Timestep Over Last Output Interval [sec]: 0.000000 ----- BODY: star ---- Active Modules: STELLAR Module Bit Sum: 65 Color: 000000 (Mass) Mass [kg]: 1.988410e+30 (Radius) Radius [m]: 9.975600e+08 (RadGyra) Radius of Gyration/Moment of Inertia Constant []: 0.449297 (RotAngMom) Rotational Angular Momentum [kg*m^2/sec]: 2.904811e+43 (RotVel) Rotational Velocity [m/sec]: 7.254461e+04 (BodyType) Type of Body (0 == planet) []: 0.000000 (RotRate) Rotational Frequency [/sec]: 7.272205e-05 (RotPer) Rotational Period [sec]: 8.640000e+04 (Density) Average Density [kg/m^3]: 478.189663 (HZLimitDryRunaway) Semi-major axis of Dry Runaway HZ Limit [m]: 1.084537e+11 (HZLimRecVenus) Recent Venus HZ Limit [m]: 9.447390e+10 (HZLimRunaway) Runaway Greenhouse HZ Limit [m]: 1.254258e+11 (HZLimMoistGreenhouse) Moist Greenhouse HZ Limit [m]: 1.250040e+11 (HZLimMaxGreenhouse) Maximum Greenhouse HZ Limit [m]: 2.269291e+11 (HZLimEarlyMars) Early Mars HZ Limit [m]: 2.475328e+11 (Instellation) Orbit-averaged INcident STELLar radiATION [kg*m^2/sec^2/(m^2*sec)]: -1.000000 (CriticalSemiMajorAxis) Holman &amp;

Parameters listed in parenthesis can be added to the outparams dictionary. Adding XUV luminosity as an output parameter . Say we also want to model the XUV luminosity of our star. vplanet includes the Ribas+2005 empirical model for XUV evolution of low-mass, which is parameterized by a broken power law: . \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{L_{\\rm XUV}}{L_{\\rm bol}} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{lcr} f_\\mathrm{sat} &amp;\\ &amp; t \\leq t_\\mathrm{sat} \\\\ f_\\mathrm{sat}\\left(\\frac{t}{t_\\mathrm{sat}}\\right)^{-\\beta_\\mathrm{XUV}} &amp;\\ &amp; t &gt; t_\\mathrm{sat} \\end{array} \\right. \\end{align}\\] This model assumes that young (more active) stars exhibit a “saturated” level of XUV luminosity relative to bolometric (total luminosity), which then decays exponentially over time, after a “saturation time”. Here $L_{\\rm bol}$ is the bolometric luminosity [$L_\\odot$], $L_{\\rm XUV}$ is the XUV luminosity [$L_\\odot$], $f_\\mathrm{sat} = \\log_{10}(L_{\\rm XUV}/L_{\\rm bol})$ is the saturation ratio, $t_\\mathrm{sat}$ is the duration of saturation phase [Gyr], $\\beta_\\mathrm{XUV}$ is the exponential decay rate of $L_{\\rm XUV}$ after saturation, and $t$ is the evolution time [Gyr]. To have vplanet compute the XUV lumiosity evolution using this model, we’ll add the following input variables to our body infiles (since they are properties of the star, they will go in star.in): . dSatXUVFrac dSatXUVTime dXUVBeta . And we will also add the following variable to our output variables in saOutputOrder: . LXUVTot . inparams = {\"star.dMass\": u.Msun, \"star.dSatXUVFrac\": u.dex(u.dimensionless_unscaled), \"star.dSatXUVTime\": u.Gyr, \"vpl.dStopTime\": u.Gyr, \"star.dXUVBeta\": -u.dimensionless_unscaled} outparams = {\"final.star.Radius\": u.Rsun, \"final.star.Luminosity\": u.Lsun, \"final.star.LXUVStellar\": u.Lsun} vpm = vpi.VplanetModel(inparams=inparams, outparams=outparams, inpath=inpath, outpath=outpath, time_init=5e6*u.yr, timesteps=1e6*u.yr, verbose=True) . Example: evolution of Trappist-1 . Make modifications to the template above by subsituting different input parameter values, then execute and plot your results. Try using the parameters from Birky et al. 2021 for the Trappist-1 exoplanet hosting system. [your code goes here...] . Habitable zone limits . How does the “habitable zone” vary for Trappist-1?

    "content": "We’re so excited to release Just the Docs v0.4.0. This release has been almost a year in the making - after our new maintenance team has taken over the project, we’ve added two years of backlogged features and bugfixes to modernize the theme. This CHANGELOG will summarize some of the key changes, discuss migrations strategies, and outline broad future plans for this theme. Brief Overview - Highlighted Changes . v0.4.0 contains many new features and bugfixes. We enumerate all of them in further sections in this changelog; however, we’d like to call out some of the most-requested changes: . | better support for dark theme: dark highlighting, search input color | callouts, a new design component to highlight content | configuring mermaid.js, a markdown-native diagram visualization library | copy code button for code snippets | external navigation links | major improvements to nav generation efficiency and robustness | minor improvements to built-in accessibility (SVG icons, nav titles, skip to main content) | modularized site components (advanced feature) | new custom includes: table of contents heading, navigation panel footer, search placeholder, lunr search indices | bugfixes involving WEBrick and Ruby 3, Liquid processing in CSS comments, nested task lists, relative URLs, scroll navigation, corrupted search data from rake, breadcrumbs, and more! | more documentation for custom includes, this changelog, and the migration guide | . After usage instructions and the roadmap, we enumerate all changes from v0.3.3. Using Release v0.4.0 . Unlike pre-releases, v0.4.0 is a new semver minor release for the theme. That means that users who have not pinned the theme version will be automatically upgraded to v0.4.0 the next time they build their site. To use this release explicitly as a remote theme: . remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.4.0 . To use this RC explicitly as a gem-based theme, pin the version in your Gemfile and re-run bundle install or bundle update just-the-docs: . gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.4.0\" . If you would prefer to not upgrade, you can enforce that explicitly: . | pin your gem version in your Gemfile, like so gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.3.3\" . | freeze the remote_theme, like so remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.3.3 . | . Migration Guide and Strategies . We’ve developed a new migration guide for users to migrate from version v0.3.3 to v0.4.0. It outlines major changes in project maintenance (e.g. new repository link, team) as well as breaking changes that may break your site (and potential solutions). We suggest that all users refer to the guide before manually upgrading their site. For the vast majority of users, we do not anticipate that this will be a breaking change. The major touch points are surrounding new includes, navigation (ordering, pages, and collections), the favicon, and a shift to relative URLs. However, users who heavily customize the theme (primarily by overriding includes) will likely have to make minor changes. Given the length of features added in this release, users may want to incrementally upgrade through the pre-releases. To follow this approach, read this changelog from v0.4.0.rc1 to v0.4.0.rc5; this breaks down the release into small chunks, each of which should be easier to upgrade. v0.4.0.rc5 is identical to this release. For support with migrating to v0.4.0, open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! . Roadmap (What’s Next?) . Moving forward, we plan to release more frequently with smaller, bite-sized changes. This should make it easier for users to upgrade in the future! . Broadly, many features are still on the radar. We anticipate the rest of v0.4.x to be bugfixes surrounding this new release. For version v0.5, our roadmap includes: . | a theme toggle (light/dark mode), with automatic theme switching based on browser preferences | better GDPR compliance for analytics | multi-level/recursive navigation (unlimited hierarchy of child pages) | . In future versions, we also plan on: . | adding better dark theme defaults | adding better internationalization support | exploring offline PDF generation | improving accessibility within the theme | improving search functionality | refactoring and improving the robustness of our codebase | . Have ideas for what’s next, or want to get involved? Open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! We’re looking for more contributors and maintainers to help us develop the theme.

In addition, it fixes bugs introduced in .rc4: incorrect CSS, inconsistencies with code block backgrounds in dark theme, and the copy code button. It also adds a migration guide for users coming from v0.3.3. Trying out pre-release v0.4.0.rc5 . Similar to the prior release, v0.4.0.rc5 is a release candidate for the theme (i.e., a pre-release) with release v0.4.0 following immediately after. While we don’t anticipate many users using this RC, it is still possible to opt-in. To use this RC explicitly as a remote theme: . remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.4.0.rc5 . To use this RC explicitly as a gem-based theme, pin the version in your Gemfile and re-run bundle install or bundle update just-the-docs: . gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.4.0.rc5\" .

Big ones include fixing the rake command, using relative_url, and search input color | More documentation, especially on using custom includes | Updating core dependencies to stable Ruby versions | A WIP template repository that allows you to setup your own repository using Just the Docs and GitHub Pages with one click - give it a shot! More documentation, etc. is on the way! | . We want your feedback! Are these changes helpful? Are our docs easy to understand? Should new features like mermaid be opt-in or opt-out? Please open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! . Trying out pre-release v0.4.0.rc1 . Due to the massive scope of these changes, we’re making v0.4.0.rc1 available as a release candidate for the theme (i.e., a pre-release) with release v0.4.0 coming soon.

We’re very thankful for the work that he’s done to create and maintain one of the most popular Jekyll themes. Please join us in giving him thanks! . The new core team currently consists of @mattxwang, @pdmosses, @skullface, @dougaitken, and @max06. Over the past six months, we’ve been triaging and merging in PRs, as well as contributing our own fixes. We’ll continue to address open issues, merge in PRs from the community, and plan out the future of Just the Docs. If you’d like to contribute, now is a great time! . Roadmap . In the short-term, we’re committed to tidying up everything for a v0.4.0 release. This involves fixing bugs reported from the community in this pre-release, as well as continually merging in minor PRs. We’re also scoping out medium and long-term projects, and want to keep you in the loop. These include: . | upgrading to Jekyll 4, and stopping support for Jekyll 3 | versioned docs - issue #728 | improved accessibility - issues #566, #870 | internationalization (i18n) - issue #59 | recursive/multi-level navigation - PR #462 | toggleable dark mode - issue #234 | . as well as DX improvements like better regression tests, CI, and tooling.

Infile templates have now been added to the project repo (in yupra/infiles) rather than pulling them from vplanet_inference. Week 2 . 06/24 . | Sync your fork at https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/yupra/ with the main repo . | On your computer in terminal, go to your project folder and pull the latest version from your fork that you just synced: cd ~/research/yupra . If you have uncommitted changes, make sure to commit those before pulling (replacing &lt;your username&gt; in the command): . git add &lt;your username&gt;/ git commit -m \"add tutorial work\" . Then pull the new changes: . git pull . When you type ls, you should see some new folders have been added: . /yupra /8-57am /docs /infiles /jbirky /JCruz001 /jgomez /kari /malachyc11 /Michelle161 /mmarquez /README.md /rory /tutorials /workshop /.git /.github /.gitignore . | Copy the file /jbirky/stellar_johnstone.ipynb to your own folder (replacing &lt;your username&gt; in the command): cp jbirky/stellar_johnstone.ipynb &lt;your username&gt;/ . | Open jupyter notebook and navigate to the file you just copied at &lt;your username&gt;/stellar_johnstone.ipynb . | Once you’ve completed the notebook above (doing parameter sweeps for Trappist-1), play around with the parameters for other stars using the data here and see if you can find a “best fit”: https://jbirky.github.io/yupra/docs/datasets.html . | star | assignee | . | 55 Cnc | Karime | . | GJ 1132 | Josue | . | GJ 3470 | Malachy | . | HD 219134 | Julizza | . | HD 97658 | Michelle | . | Kepler-138 | Alex | . | Kepler-18 | Rory | . | Trappist-1 | Jess | . | .
